# 🎲 Dice Roller

## 📝 Description
Dice roller is a simple Python project that simulates rolling two dice randomly.  
Each time the user chooses to "roll", the program generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, then displays the result on the screen.

## 🧩 Features & Concepts Used
This project demonstrates the use of:
* 🔁 Loops (`while`)
* 🔍 Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* 🎲 The `random` module to generate random numbers
* 💬 Basic user interaction via input and output

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program asks if you want to roll the dice (`y/n`).
2. If you enter "y" or "yes", two random numbers between 1 and 6 will appear as the dice result.
3. If you enter "n" or "no", the program will stop with a goodbye message.
4. If you enter anything else, the program will display an “Invalid input” message.
